### Hi there 👋

- 🌱 I’m currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Technology, majored in Computer Science & specialised in Machine learning. Well, am still learning...

- 🔭 I’m currently working on multiple projects, including my very own portfolio which I'd be publishing soon ;)

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on a real-time decrbonization project in the farms!

- 💬 Feel free to talk to me: about yourself, for motivation and healthy discussions on anything (tech to life, just anything 😉)

- 📫 You can reach me at sriashikaa299@hotmail.com

- ⚡ Fun fact: It only takes 17 muscles (or even lesser) to smile, so say cheese... 😁
