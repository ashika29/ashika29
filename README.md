### Hi there 👋

🌱 I’m currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, specialised in Machine learning. Well, am always learning...

🔭 I’ve worked on multiple projects, some are ongoing - including my very own portfolio which I'd be publishing soon ;)

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on a real-time decrbonization project in the farms!

💬 Feel free to talk to me about anything: yourself, for motivation and healthy discussions on anything (tech to life, just anything 😉)

📫 You can reach me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/sriashika-addala/

⚡ Fun fact: It only takes 17 muscles (or even lesser) to smile, so say cheese... 😁
